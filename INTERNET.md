## HTTP
***HTTP is the TCP/IP based application layer communication protocol which standardizes how the client and server communicate with each other. It defines how the content is requested and transmitted across the internet.***

## IP ADDRESS

## DNS
***The Domain Name System (DNS) is the phonebook of the Internet. Humans access information online through domain names, like nytimes.com or espn.com. Web browsers interact through Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load Internet resources.***

## MASK / SUBNET

## Browsers and how they work?
***A web browser is a software application that enables a user to access and display web pages or other online content through its graphical user interface.***

## What is hosting and domain name?
***Web hosting is an online service that allows you to publish your website files onto the internet. So, anyone who has access to the internet has access to your website.

A domain name is a unique, easy-to-remember address used to access websites, such as ‘google.com’, and ‘facebook.com’. Users can connect to websites using domain names thanks to the DNS system***
