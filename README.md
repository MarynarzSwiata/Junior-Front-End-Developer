# Projects plan ()
+ How to plan vessel rotation for deck & engine officers
+ Usage of paper across the maritime fleet
+ Maritime jobs (job titles, companies, salaries, locations, required skills, and so on. Graphing skillsets against salaries.)
+ Vessels statistics in selected 3 flags (size, types, quantity)
+ The Internet Movie Database (movies and tv series trends in 2021-2022)
+ Maritime prices agaist regular prices ashore
+ Global suicide rates (This global suicide rates dataset covers suicide rates in various countries, with additional data including year, gender, age, population, GDP, and more. When carrying out your EDA, ask yourself: What patterns can you see? Are suicides rates climbing or falling in various countries? What variables (such as gender or age) can you find that might correlate to suicide rates?)
+ World Happiness Report (On the other end of the scale, the World Happiness Report tracks six factors to measure happiness across the world’s citizens: life expectancy, economics, social support, absence of corruption, freedom, and generosity. So, which country is the happiest? Which continent? Which factor appears to have the greatest (or smallest) impact on a nation’s happiness? Overall, is happiness increasing or decreasing?)
+ Seafarers COVID-19 (the pandemic is nothing if not topical! What’s more, sites like Kaggle already have thousands of Covid-19 data sets available. How can you represent the data? Could you use a global heatmap to show where cases have spiked, versus where there are very few? Perhaps you could create two overlapping bar charts to show known infections versus predicted infections. Here’s a handy tutorial to help you visualize Covid-19 data using R, Shiny, and Plotly.)
+ Travel data (Another topic that lends itself well to visualization is transport data. There are great step-by-step tutorials out there for how to visualize travel data, flight data being a prime example. For instance, check out data scientist Spencer J Fox’s flight data visualizations using ggplot2, a data visualization package for R.)
